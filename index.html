								<h2>Masculinity Is Not Default
									<br />
								</h2>
							</header>
							<p>In the past few years, unisex clothing lines have become more prevalent. Pictures flooded the internet of men and women wearing dull tan and white clothes. The models wear long tunics with boot cut pants and have short cropped hair. This style is supposed to be inclusive and for everyone, but frequently misses the mark of what unisex actually is.<p/>

<p>These clothing lines claim styled around all genders, but are never designed with females in mind. The clothes are always end up being overtly masculine, forgetting about all the other genders. This happens all too often in the video game industry and community.<p/>
<p>
Masculine is not default. Masculinity is not a neutral zone that represents everyone. This problem plagues the video game industry as many developer do not think of other genders when producing their games.
Yes, many others do enjoy playing games that are traditionally masculine. Some do not even care, but I do. When I play video games, I can tell that a person such as myself was never thought of during development. there are tall tale signs of when they make these games for only a traditionally masculine audience.
<p/>
<p>
I want to play games where I can bond with the characters. I want to play a game where I can be girly and badass. I want to besoft and kind, but also unforgiving and resentful. Unisex is supposed to be 'suitable' for both gender, but suitable isn't enough. There need to be thought put in the creation of this game where there is no one forgotten or left behind during development. There are a few developers that are conscious of this need.
<p/>
<p>
One developer that this does well is Bioware. Bioware has created characters from all spectrum of life. They let you take the time to develop your character and grow attachments to the world around you through the storytelling. The game was developed with more than one type of person in mind and it shows by its devoted and diverse fandom. Their newest release, Anthem, does an excellence job of using gender neutral characters without making some character lose all femininity.<p/>
<p>The new battle royale, Apex Legends, is quickly taking the genre by storm. The game requires no actual voice communicate which caters to those who face harassment online. The cast of legend playable characters were meticulously designed with people from all walks of life in mind.<p/>
<p>
One popular game that was designed with only one type of person in mind is Grand Theft Auto. This game promotes violence against sex workers and uses coarse storytelling to move the narrative forward. This game is beloved by its fans, but despised by more.<p/>
<p>
The biggest issue in video games is that people need choices on how to represent themselves. Being unisex doesn't mean resorting to a masculine state. Being gender neutral in video games means having the freedom to present yourself in anyway that feels comfortable.

<h2>
	The Virtual Coffee Shop: Online Gaming Lobbies Becoming the New Central Perk.
	<br />
</h2>
</header>
	<p>A few weeks ago, I read a Kotaku article by Cecilia D'Anastasio entitled ‘Overwatch is No Longer My Third Place.’ D’Anatasio begins the article by describing how video games are becoming physical places. She uses a Friends metaphor to describe the virtual space:
	<p/>
	<p>
“It used to be that on most weeknights, between the hours of 9 p.m. and 11 p.m., a green dot would accompany my Battle.net tag. It had been like that for years. Overwatch was a place where friends could find me, like the neighborhood coffee shop in “Friends” or the corner pub.”
<p/>
<p>
Any person who has watched Friends can summon the image of Central Perk. A quaint New York City coffee shop where the titular group of friends spend nearly all their time. I can picture Ross finding Rachel sitting on the infamous couch or Chandler running inside to tell his friends his latest crazy experience. All the characters expected to find one another there if they weren’t at work or home.
<p/>
<p>
Online video games are becoming the new Central Perk. People can go online on their consoles and PCs and find their friends there as if meeting them in a physical space.
<p/>
<p>
The biggest example of this is Fortnite. This battle royale-style game has changed the way children play with each other. This game is no longer home to just competitive environment; instead, Fortnite functions as a meeting place or a chat room. Kids use the in-game chat, their phones, and discord to communicate and use the game features to have a feeling of togetherness.
<p/>
<p>
Recently, Fortnite added a creative mode feature that allows users to create challenges for their friends. This mode takes away the life-or-death situation of a battle royale and lets the players interact with each other’s creations. This adds to the thinking of games as a physical space as players are invested in these worlds they create.
<p/>
<p>
When I was younger, I played a massively multiplayer online game called Free Realms. The game allowed you to level up in different classes, making it take a long time to reach  the highest level in every one. It has since shut down, but I vividly remember the friendships that I cultivated. This MMO allowed me to interact with people that I never could have known otherwise. These games are no longer just games; they are catalysts for friendship.
<p/>
<p>
Anthem is one of the newest online games released. This game puts the player into a 'world left unfinished by the gods' and gives them an exoskeleton suit similar to Iron Man's. Players team up in alliances of four to take on the enemies. One piece of the game that was added late in development was a feature called the Launch Bay. The Launch Bay is a room where players can meet up after a mission, but is accessible at anytime. The developer, Bioware, realized that players needed a place where they could interact outside of battle and develop a sense of camaraderie.
<p/>
<p>
Some games allow players to bond without ever having to say a word to each other. Apex Legends is the newest battle royale on the market. This game has a new 'ping' system that has never been implemented in any other. By clicking a single button, players can signal their teammates about loot, enemies, and new locations. 'Pinging' allows players to speak to each other without actually having to a mic.
<p/>
<p>
Another way games have created online spaces is by connecting fans through fan art, fan fiction, and more. People who have played the same game have experienced an adventure together and have shared experiences to draw from. I have made many a friendship through talking about how we faced challenges and the way we were able to defeat them.
Other popular games that foster this kind of are Overwatch, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, and more. These games create an environment that does not actually exist; they create a Central Perk kind of feeling without ever leaving the comfort of your home.
<p/>
<h2> Humans of Dragon Age </h2>
</header>
<p>The first time I heard of Dragon Age was through an article in the Guardian by Kate Gray about Dorian, a powerful mage and a member of nobility who prefers to spend his time doing magical research. I was spending my first summer home from college and desperately missed student life. My hometown is in the middle of nowhere and I had nothing to do, but work and play video games all summer.<p/>
<p>I vividly remember the quote from the article that drew me in, “When I wasn’t slaughtering enemies, I would go and chat to him in the library (where he could often be found perusing the Dragon Age equivalent of Mills & Boon novels), just to hear about his day. I waited patiently for the moment when our relentless, banterous flirting would come to its explosive conclusion. And then suddenly it did, but as a measure of the game’s relative emotional complexity, it didn’t go as planned.” I could picture these moments in my mind  and looked up the game and my curiosity grew tremendously with every article I read.<p/>
<p>The one game store in my town has since closed down, but I used to visit frequently just to be around games and see what I could discover. The day after I read the article, I went searching for Dragon Age: Inquisition, but I had no idea what rabbit hole I was going down.<p/>
<p>I found the pre-owned game for ten dollars and chatted briefly with the game store employees about it. They didn’t know anything about it. I shrugged, handed over my money, and went home to play my game.<p/>
<p>I didn’t realize that I would still be thinking, writing, obsessing over it now nearly four years later.<p/>
<p>Dragon Age incorporates a mechanic that allows you to bond with the characters in the game. You gather followers throughout the game that help you in combat. These followers are full of life and fleshed out characters. They have backstories, lives, and families, and they can agree and disagree with your actions to the point that they will try to kill you. And they can fall in love with you.<p/>
<p>The stories that Dragon Age tells through these characters are wonderful, kind, sad, heartbreaking, but most of all, human. Dorian, the aforementioned mage, struggles with his family accepting his sexuality. Sera, an elven troublemaker, works tirelessly to help through affected by the wars of the upper class. Cullen, the commander of the Inquisition armies, struggles with addiction. Your character throughout the struggle of good and evil, also has the opportunity to get to known and help the people that fight alongside them.<p/>
<p>By the decisions you make, your followers can start to hate you or even fall in love with you. In one instance, one of your follower can claim to be fully committed to you, but still betray you and attempt to kill you if you make one wrong choice.<p/>
<p>I fell in love with the game because of these characters and their stories. The more I learned about the development, the more sense the artistry of the game made. All of the lead writers had numerous novels in circulation. These people weren’t developers who turned to writing. These were people who loved the craft of writing and decided that the best way to tell their stories was through this series of games. <p/>
